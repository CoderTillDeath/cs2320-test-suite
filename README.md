# COSC 2320 Testing Suite
---
I have made a set of scripts to make to make testing easier for those of us in this class, since our professor has not provided one himself. I have a series of scripts that you can use via the command line in order to help with testing your program. 

### Prerequisites
In order to use my test suite, you will need g++, a c++ compiler. Here's the link for g++:

http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/g++/g++.html

To verify that g++ is installed on your computer, open up a terminal or command prompt and type **g++**: 
```
C:\Users\Benson>g++
g++: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
```
If you get the above error, then you are set. If instead you got this: 
```
C:\Users\Benson>g++
'g++' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
Then you may need to do some troubleshooting.
### Setup
---
Before you start using the scripts, you need to do some initial configuration. In order to make configuration easier, I have included a file called **settings.sh** in order to make things configuration easy. Here is what the settings.sh file looks like: 
```
fileName="uhstack"
testDirectory="test-cases/"
inputFileFormat="test-&.txt"
outputFileFormat="out-&.txt"
letters="a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t"
```
The above file has all that you need to fill out in order to get the scripts to work. A brief explanation for each option

- fileName - Just put the name of the assignment file for this field. **NOT THE NAME OF THE CPP FILE**, but the name that professor has mandated. So for assignment 3, the professor has called for the file to be named **uhstack**. 
- testDirectory - This will be the folder in which you put your test cases in. I recommend downloading all of them and putting them in a folder with your cpp file, like so: 
```
hw3
|
+---> main.cpp
+---> test-cases
      |
      +--->test-a.txt
      +--->out-a.txt
      +--->test-b.txt
      +--->out-b.txt
      +--->test-c.txt
      +--->out-c.txt
```
- inputFileFormat and outputFileFormat - The format that the files follow. Put an **&** symbol where the file changes letters. So for the example I gave above, the inputFileFormat would be "test-&.txt", and the output format will be "out-&.txt".
- letters - Type out every letter test case that is in the test cases folder
---
Here are the scripts: 
- outputForFile.sh - Takes one argument for the letter of the file, and spits out the output for the given test case
- answerForFile.sh - Takes one argument for the letter of the file, and prints out the correct output for the given test case.
- inputFile.sh - Takes one argument for the letter of the file, gives you the input file.
- test.sh - Takes one argument for the letter of the file, sees if the output from your file matches the correct output
- runTests.sh - Runs test.sh for all letters

---
#### A Few Advanced Scripts
- diffOutput.sh - Gives you the diff output for a certain test case, if you prefer looking at diff
- rTestsThrough.sh - Runs test cases until a certain letter that you give. Promotes continuous integration.

## Example Use Case
So, I'm gonna walk through a few key moments that I experienced while doing hw2. So, let's begin! I start by going to my linux box, creating a folder called "hw2", and cd-ing into it.

Now, I'm going to get the test suite and the test cases for the homework.

![alt text](pictures/16:52:06.png?raw=true "Logo Title Text 1")

We have the test suite and the test cases now. Let's configure the test suite. I'm going to open the file "settings.sh" with the **nano** test editor. You can open it with notepad or whatever you use.

![alt text](pictures/16:52:21.png?raw=true "Logo Title Text 1")

This is what the configuration looks like: 

![alt text](pictures/16:54:05.png?raw=true "Logo Title Text 1")

Save it and exit. You are now set up to use the test suite! I'm gonna open up another terminal, so I can have one terminal in the test-suite folder, and one in the "hw2" folder.

![alt text](pictures/16:55:00.png?raw=true "Logo Title Text 1")

I'm gonna open up a file called coogsive.cpp and setup a hello world program. This is what the program looks like: 

![alt text](pictures/16:55:59.png?raw=true "Logo Title Text 1")

Notice that to the right, I have invoked my first script: "outputForFile.sh". What that script does is automatically feed the specified input to the c++ program. Here's a demonstration.
